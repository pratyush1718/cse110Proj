[I don't care about you as a programmer](#as-a-person)

## As a programmer:
**Programmming Languages**: *Java, Python, C++, ARM Assembly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS*

**Software & Tools**: *React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Postman, REST API’s, Pandas, NLTK, Tensorflow, Pytorch, MATLAB, Matplotlib, Selenium, Jupyter, Ubuntu, Git*

**Favorite CS quote**:

> “Instead of trying to produce a
program to simulate the adult mind,
why not rather try to produce one
which simulates the child’s?
If this were then subjected to an
appropriate course of education
one would obtain the adult brain.”

**Short Programming Snippet in different languages of the single best line of code ever written**
```
Console.log("Hello World")
System.out.println("Hello World")
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
print('Hello World')
```

## As a person:

I am big on music and have been drumming for over a decade now. My favorite drummer, currently, is Larnell Lewis. My favorite performance of his was [Chick's Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIW72VXMPHo).
